# Quantum Algorithms Implementation in PennyLane

This repository contains Python implementations of popular quantum algorithms using **PennyLane**, a quantum computing library. The algorithms implemented include:

- **Deutsch's Algorithm**
- **Deutsch-Josza Algorithm**
- **Bernstein-Vazirani Algorithm**

## Prerequisites

To run the code, you need to install the following libraries:

- [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
### Explanation of Structure:

1. **Section for Each Algorithm**: Each algorithm (Deutsch's, Deutsch-Josza, Bernstein-Vazirani, Simon's) has its own section. This includes:
   - **Cell 1**: Defining the quantum device.
   - **Cell 2**: Defining the oracle.
   - **Cell 3**: Writing the quantum algorithm.
   - **Cell 4**: Printing the measurement results.
   - **Cell 5**: Drawing the quantum circuit using `draw_mpl`.

2. **Code Snippets**: 
   The code snippets follow the structure as described with each algorithm, making it easy to understand how the algorithm works step-by-step.
